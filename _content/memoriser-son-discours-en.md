teaser1: "Having an impact during a discussion or speech requires a certain oral fluency.

In this workshop the participants will discover the different stages of a talk (implication, development, message) and will build their own 'naval battle map' to be at ease when talking to an audience of one or many."
teaser2: "Based on improvisational theater techniques, participants will develop an impactful and fluid speech and practice their oral presenting."
