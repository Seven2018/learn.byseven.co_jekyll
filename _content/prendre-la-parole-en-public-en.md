teaser1: "Specific rules govern the functioning of public speaking, such as the 'menu: entrée-dish-dessert'."
teaser2: "On the example of TED conferences, participants will be trained at the stages of a successful talk. Then, on a subject of their choice, they will be invited to speak in front of the assembly, in front of a camera (optional) and to work on their scenic presence. This workshop allows you to develop an ability to express yourself with impact and master the tools to refine a pitch / speech."
